# BeerSnob Gem

## Purpose

App users can look up different types of beer by style and learn more 
about each type.

## Layout

The app will welcome the user and display the name of the gem -- BeerSnob. 
There will be a list of beer style families to choose from numerically.

Once the user chooses a beer style family, a list of beer style names 
within that family will be displayed to choose from numerically. The user 
will then select a beer style name and be shown more details.

Each beer style page will show: the beer style family, the beer style 
name, a short description of the beer style, commercial examples of the 
beer style (listing beer name and brewery), beer style characteristics, 
and common food pairings.

On each page, the user will have the option to go back one page in the 
app, go home (except for home page), ask for help, and view an "A-Z Style 
Guide" for more details on what each beer characteristic entails. Also 
I may enable the user to proceed to the next beer style from another 
beer style page within each beer style family.
